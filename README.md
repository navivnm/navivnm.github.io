Mobile App Compliance Files
This repository contains the privacy.txt and app-ads.txt files for my mobile application. These files are required by ad networks and privacy regulations to ensure transparency and proper ad inventory management.

üìÑ What are these files?
app-ads.txt

The app-ads.txt file is a standard created by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) to prevent ad fraud in mobile apps. It allows ad buyers to verify that a mobile app publisher is authorized to sell the ad inventory in their app.

Purpose: To publicly declare who is authorized to sell your app's ad space.

Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized ad resellers from profiting from your app and helps increase ad revenue by building trust with advertisers.

privacy.txt

The privacy.txt file is a simple, human-readable document that provides a public, easy-to-find link to your app's official Privacy Policy. While not an official IAB standard, it has been adopted by some ad platforms to streamline the process of finding your privacy information.

Purpose: To provide a clear, machine-readable link to your full Privacy Policy.

Why it's important: It simplifies compliance and helps ad networks and users quickly access your privacy information, which is a key part of many global privacy regulations.
