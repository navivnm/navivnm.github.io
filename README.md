Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 12, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how OCR Handwritten and its developer, Naveen Vijay, collect, use, and protect your information.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

A. Non-Personal Information

When you use the App, we collect information that does not personally identify you. This includes:

Images for Text Extraction: The core function of the App is to extract text from images you provide. The images are sent to Azure AI Services for analysis and are immediately discarded after processing. We do not store or use your images for any other purpose. The extracted text itself is also not stored by us.
Device Information: We collect information about the device you use to access the App, such as the device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers. We use this information to serve personalized advertisements.
iCloud Data Synchronization: We store your consumable scan count using Apple's iCloud service (NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore). This allows you to retain your scan count and use it across any device signed into the same Apple ID. We do not collect or use this data for any purpose other than providing a consistent user experience.
B. Personal Information

The App does not directly collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from you, such as your name or email address, with one exception. When you submit feedback, we collect the text of your feedback. This feedback is not tied to your identity.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide the Service: We send images you provide to a third-party service (Azure AI Services) to perform the text extraction you requested.
For Advertising: We use your device identifier to serve personalized ads to you through Google AdMob. This helps us to support the App's free features.
For In-App Purchases: When you make a purchase, the transaction is handled directly by Apple StoreKit. We do not collect or store your payment information. We may use transaction receipts to verify and fulfill your purchase and to provide you with access to premium content.
